distribution-safety-data.py is used to see the distribution of LD20 safety assays plotted in slide 5 of the pdf.

correlation-matrix-LD20.py is used to calculate and plot the correlations between different safety assays as shown in slide 6 of the pdf.

property-distribution.py is used to calculate the distribution shown in 11. The input data used is SMILES file in the folder

distribution-shape-smiles.py used to calculate shape descriptors for the SMILES and plot the distribution shown in slide 12
pca-shape-tox.py is used to calculate the shape descriptors for the compounds and perform PCA analysis on this data to get the heatmap shown in slide 13

jupyternotebook named has all the cluster analysis, r-group decomposition and Structure-activity relationship matrix calculations and output data to be viewed. The input files are attached along
