# SAR-R-Group-Decomposition

distribution-safety-data.py is used to see the distribution of LD20 safety assays.

correlation-matrix-LD20.py is used to calculate and plot the correlations between different safety assays.

property-distribution.py is used to calculate the distribution of properties. The input data used is SMILES file in the folder

distribution-shape-smiles.py used to calculate shape descriptors for the SMILES and plot the distribution shown in slide 12
pca-shape-tox.py is used to calculate the shape descriptors for the compounds and perform PCA analysis on this data to get the heatmap.

jupyternotebook named has all the cluster analysis, r-group decomposition and Structure-activity relationship matrix calculations and output data to be viewed. The input files are attached along
